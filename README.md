## Introduction

This is a small web app built on [Meteor JS](http://meteor.com/) to
leverage the [LCBO API](http://lcboapi.com/).

The app uses the following APIs:
- [http://lcboapi.com/docs/products](http://lcboapi.com/docs/products)
- [http://lcboapi.com/docs/products-at-store](http://lcboapi.com/docs/products-at-store)

The background images behind the search bar are created by pulling in a list of
products from the API with images and displaying them in a random order.

## Setup

- Install [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)
- Download the repository
- From within the app, run `meteor` in the terminal
